I managed to do the rest of yesterday's posts' tasks.

That means users can try AlbumCoverAI for free. The landing page now asks for a sign-up rather than asking for money first.

Once signed up, the user can create up to 100 images; however, he's not allowed to upscale them.

At the final moment, where you've chosen your image, removed unwanted spots, and added your text, you need to purchase credits to upscale the image to 4000x4000 (the credits also allow you to generate 150 additional images).

_This is what the upsell button looks like._

I hope this converts more users or lets them sign up to try the app. Their risk is gone.

While there's hope, there's also fear. Fear that people will abuse this - a malevolent person could sign up with multiple emails or download the images by right-clicking. I'll add a watermark for that.

But I view it as an experiment. My payment limits are set, so I won't pay more than $100 tops, even if people go bonkers. The learning experience is worth it.

Let's see. If this doesn't work, my only idea is to have a more convincing feature: using your face on the cover. After all, my app does what other image generation AIs do - adding presets, upscaling, inspiring images and text on top. The face feature would be something special.

Before I'd build the use-your-own-face-feature, I'd validate it with a campaign. I don't want to fall into the trap of building features nobody wants.

I'll turn on my Facebook ads again and report how it goes tomorrow.
