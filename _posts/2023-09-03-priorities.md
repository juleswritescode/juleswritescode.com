Today, a quick note on priorities and time management.

Everybody talks about priorities. You're supposed to have them, and you're supposed to act in accordance with them. If you play video games instead of working out, well, that means video games have a higher priority than health. All right.

To me, this always seemed like an abstract concept. You pick your priorities, and then you're supposed to structure your life around them. But that doesn't _really_ work, does it?

While priorities can serve as a guide for making decisions, it's difficult to stick to them in practice. When floods of daily events demand your attention, you barely have time to make rational decisions. Instead, you act from intuition.

Let's take a closer look at what priorities actually are.

Priorities are an **ordering of goals**. As such, no two items can share a spot within that order. There are no two number two's. One has to be in the third place. Things you don't consider "a priority" simply are items lower on the list.

So, defining priorities means putting your goals in order.
But here's the twist: You don't **choose** your priorities, instead, you vote with your actions - or rather, with how you spend your time.

Video games will only be high on your priority list if you _play video games first._
Your order of actions determines your priorities. The thing you spend your time on first is your number one priority.

"But I have to work at 9 am, so I can't work on my own projects before!" - yes, you're right. If you think about it, your own projects are _not_ your number one priority. Your job and the benefits - a salary, being able to pay rent and food - are your number one (and that's okay).

I am in Mainz with my girlfriend today, and we'll spend a nice day in the city together. I haven't worked on my SaaS yet. That shows: My girlfriend has a higher priority than my SaaS; otherwise, I'd stay in and work. Regardless of any written list.

Alright, but what's the practical advice?

Instead of creating an arbitrary list of priorities, focus on how you spend your day. What do you currently do first? What _should_ you do first? Are you doing things (such as working out) before others (working on projects)? Does this reflect the importance of your individual goals?

If you'd like to prioritize X over Y, do X first. Change your schedule, and plan your day accordingly. Get up earlier.

Writing a list is just circle-jerking.
